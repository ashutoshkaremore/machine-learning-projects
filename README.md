# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Machine Learning** projects!  
This repository showcases hands-on implementations of various ML techniques, data preprocessing workflows, model training pipelines, and end-to-end use case solutions.

Whether you're a beginner trying to learn or a recruiter assessing practical skills — this repo is meant to **demonstrate applied ML knowledge in real-world scenarios**.
